= blender addon for rendering to versioned output folders
:revnumber: 0.3.0

When you change frame or when you load a new file this addon will look for a `VERSION.txt` file next to the blend file.
If found, it will set the output to be `target/{version}/{basename}`, where `basename` was the original basename specified on the `out` field.

Will also add a 'Version to out' section in the render panel with an option to `Nest in subfolders per mark`.
If this is checked, then the version will change with the last timeline mark from where the cursor is.

The pattern will be `//target/{version}/{name}/{marker}/{basename}`
This will, effectively, nest the frames per mark.
